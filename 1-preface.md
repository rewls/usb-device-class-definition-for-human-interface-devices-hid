# 1. Preface

## 1.5 Document Conventions

- Words in bold with initial letter capitalized indicate elements with special meaning such as requests, descriptors, descriptor sets, classes, or subclasses.

- Proper-cased words are used to distinguish types or categories of things.

- Italicized letters or words indicate placeholders for information supplied by the developer.

- Placeholder prefixes such as '*b*', '*bcd*', and '*w*' are used to denote placeholder type.

    - For example:

        - *b*: bits or bytes; dependent on context

        - *bcd*: binary-coded decimal

        - *bm*: bitmap

        - *d*: descriptor

        - *i*: index

        - *w*: word

- Items inside square brackets are optional.

- Ellipses in syntax, code, or samples indicate 'and so on...' where additional optional items may be included.

- Braces and a vertical bar indicate a choice between two or more items or associated values.

- `This font` is used for code, pseudo-code, and samples.
